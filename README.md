## Does devEco Consulting share your personal data with a third party or country?

**We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share and disclose information (including Personal Information) about our customers in the following limited circumstances:**

If legally permitted to do so, devEco Consulting may transfer personal data to courts, law enforcement authorities, regulators or attorneys if necessary to comply with the law or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

In connection with the operation of our websites and the services provided through our websites, devEco Consulting works with service providers (so-called data processors), such as hosting or IT maintenance, which only act upon instructions of devEco Consulting and are contractually bound to act in compliance with applicable data protection law and to provide appropriate technical and organizational security measures.

Recipients of EU citizen personal data may possibly be located in countries outside of the European Union /European Economic Area (“third countries”), in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data protection as the laws of your home country.

In such cases and unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, devEco Consulting is committed to take measures in order to ensure the recipients in the third country provides an adequate level of protection.

As far as such data transfers involve recipients in countries outside the European Union or outside the European Economic Area (“Third Countries”), we will ensure that the transfers will be made in compliance with the EEA data protection provisions, to ensure that an adequate level of data protection equivalent to the GDPR is maintained.

Such safeguards could either be an adequacy decision by which the European Union has deemed the country in which the recipient is located to have adequate data protection laws in place, or the execution of EU Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as EU Model Clauses) with the recipient, or the implementation of Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) by the recipient.
